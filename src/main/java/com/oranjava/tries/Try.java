 * Purpose :
 *  We use the try-catch so much in our code (if not then you should!), but...
 *  The problem with using it becomes visible as it makes your code pretty verbose.
 *  It can even be more painful when a code must be wrapped because of potential checked exceptions.
 *
 *  To make your code (way) more readable, you may want to adopt the following suggested pattern instead : try-orElse
 *
 * For usages and further details, please follow the documentation of the methods :
 *  tryOrElse(...)
 *  unchecked(...)

     * Wraps automatically a supplied chunk of code with a try-catch (Throwable).
     *
     * Useful when one wants to simply write a concise chunk of code
     *  with the ability to react to any thrown exception - if such is raised.
     *
     * Note that the code which reacts to a raised exception may itself throw an exception.
     *  In such a case, the inner exception will be rethrown as a RuntimeException.
     *
     * Another advantage is the freedom of the need to wrap code which may throw checked exceptions.
     *
     * The following code :
     *
     *  int result;
     *  try {
     *      result = divide(dividend, divisor);
